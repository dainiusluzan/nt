## Key Areas of Misalignment ⚠️
This plan was built for a more complex and undefined project. Here’s where it no longer matches our reality:

Risk Assessment: The report lists "Performance with large datasets (>1000 points)" as a High Risk.

Insight: This risk is now eliminated. Our decision to limit the map to a maximum of 10 points makes performance a non-issue.

Technical Decisions: The report recommends choosing a map library and implementing complex data handling.

Insight: We've already made these decisions. We chose Leaflet.js, and our error handling is a simple "fail completely and display a specific message." Complex validation or caching is not needed.

Timeline & Resources: The report estimates a 4-6 week timeline.

Insight: This is now vastly overestimated. Given the simplicity of Leaflet, the small data volume, and clear error logic, the entire project can realistically be completed in 1-2 weeks by a single developer.

Cost Analysis: The report estimates $0-500/month for a map service.

Insight: Our cost for the map service is $0. Leaflet is free, and the standard tile providers (like OpenStreetMap) are also free for this level of usage.
